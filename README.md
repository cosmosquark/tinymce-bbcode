# tinymce-bbcode
An improved version of tinymce bbcode implementation. 

It's not perfect but it does a good job with the majority of html tags.

This was origionally developed for AlphaCMS, but the requirement for BBCode was dropped. Hence this project was never completed. If anyone would like to further the development of this or to tidy it up, then create a pull request!

# Setup.
Simply setup tinymce as you normally would do, then create a new folder to use as a plugin. add the plugin.js file into that folder and initialise it. Job done.
